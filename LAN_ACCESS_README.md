# üåê LAN Access Setup for BarangayLink

This guide explains how to make your BarangayLink app accessible from other devices on your local network (LAN).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using npm scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# In the frontend directory
npm run start:lan
```

### Option 2: Using provided scripts
- **Windows**: Double-click `start-lan.bat` in the frontend folder
- **Unix/Linux/Mac**: Run `./start-lan.sh` in the frontend folder

### Option 3: Manual environment variable
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:HOST="0.0.0.0"; npm start

# Unix/Linux/Mac
HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start
```

## üì± Accessing from Other Devices

1. **Find your PC's IP address:**
   - **Windows**: Run `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in Terminal
   - Look for your local IP (usually starts with `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, or `172.16-31.x.x`)

2. **Access the app:**
   - Frontend: `http://YOUR_IP:3000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:3000`)
   - Backend API: `http://YOUR_IP:5000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000`)

## üîß What Was Changed

### Backend (server.js)
- ‚úÖ Server now listens on `0.0.0.0:5000` instead of just `localhost:5000`
- ‚úÖ CORS updated to allow requests from LAN IP addresses
- ‚úÖ Added logging for LAN access

### Frontend (package.json)
- ‚úÖ Added `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"` for API calls
- ‚úÖ Added `start:lan` script for easy LAN access
- ‚úÖ Added `cross-env` dependency for cross-platform compatibility

### Frontend (apiClient.js)
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded `http://localhost:5000`
- ‚úÖ Now uses relative paths (`/api`) that work with the proxy

## üåç Network Configuration

### CORS Allowed Origins
The backend now accepts requests from:
- `http://localhost:3000` (local development)
- `http://192.x.x.x:*` (common home network range)
- `http://10.x.x.x:*` (common LAN range)
- `http://172.16-31.x.x:*` (common LAN range)

### Proxy Configuration
- Frontend dev server proxies all `/api/*` requests to `http://localhost:5000`
- This means API calls work seamlessly from any device on your network

## üß™ Testing LAN Access

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend (LAN mode)
   cd frontend
   npm run start:lan
   ```

2. **Test from another device:**
   - Open `http://YOUR_IP:3000` on your phone/tablet
   - Try to log in or register
   - Check browser console for any errors

3. **Verify API calls:**
   - All API calls should work without CORS errors
   - Login/registration should work from LAN devices

## üîí Security Notes

- This setup is for **local development only**
- Your app will be accessible to anyone on your WiFi network
- Don't use this configuration in production
- Consider using a firewall to restrict access if needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" errors
- Ensure both backend and frontend are running
- Check that backend is listening on `0.0.0.0:5000`
- Verify your firewall allows connections on ports 3000 and 5000

### CORS errors
- Restart both servers after making changes
- Check that CORS patterns in `server.js` include your network range
- Verify the proxy is working in `package.json`

### Can't access from other devices
- Ensure both servers are running with LAN access
- Check your router's settings (some routers block local network access)
- Try accessing from a device on the same WiFi network first

## üìã Summary

Your BarangayLink app is now configured for LAN access! Users on your local network can:

‚úÖ Access the frontend at `http://YOUR_IP:3000`  
‚úÖ Log in and register without errors  
‚úÖ Use all app features from mobile devices  
‚úÖ Access the API through the proxy system  

The app maintains all existing functionality while being accessible across your local network.
